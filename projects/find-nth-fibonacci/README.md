# FIND NTH FIBONACCI SEQUENCE

A simple mini project written in Rust that calculate the nth of fibonacci sequence

## Overview

This project is a practical learning exercise to demonstrate my understanding of Rust programming concepts, including:

- `Functions` and how they work
- working with `data types` and how assign them
- how `expressions` work and flow of the rust

## Features

- Calculate the nth of fibonacci sequence with a formula
- Because of that the algorithm work very fast

## Getting Started

To use this application, simply compile and run the code using Rust's `cargo` tool.

## Usage

- Run the application using `cargo run`
- Follow the prompts to convert temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius

## Future Development

This project is a starting point for further learning and development. Future features may include:

- Adding Cli interface for more joyful experience
- Implementing more advanced error handling and validation
